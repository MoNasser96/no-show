## Introduction

>No-show appointment dataset has been chosen for analyzing.
>No-show appointment dataset about patient people  appointments, health issuies, neighborhoods etc..
The plan is to check and filter this dataset to come up with relations between different types of information pieces that may help in detecting a specific pattern or determine any further steps to be taken (if possible) to help the sick people.

Looking at provided attributes, I am planning to divide them into different characteristics for my analysis:
* Scheduled Day, Appointment Day)
* Gender, Age)
* Hypertention, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handicap)

## Data Wrangling

### General Properties

#loading the data
df = pd.read_csv('noshow.csv')
#Getting the first 1 row to get a gist of the data
df.head(1)

#Getting the number of rows and numbers of columns in the dataset
df.shape

#check for null values 
df.isnull().sum()

#Getting a basic summary of the attributes in the dataset
df.describe()

#Getting the number of duplicate values if any in the dataset
sum(df.duplicated())

#invetigate age for checking strange values such -1
df['Age'].value_counts(dropna='False')

### From Data Above
* the shape of the data is (110527 Rows and 14 Colums)
* the number of duplicated data was zero 0 
* we have some colums we will not use as it's not important as 'AppointmentID','Scholarship','AppointmentID'


### issues :
>- Some has age 0 and -1 .
>- Some has non accorate Name

## Data Cleaning
- change ScheduledDay type to a datetime object .
- Remove rows with age 0 and -1
- rename columns 'Hipertension' 'Handcap':'NoShow
- combine (Hypertension , Diabetes , Alcoholism , Handicap) under diseases column


#Dropping age -1
df.drop(df[df['Age'] == -1].index, inplace = True)
df.drop(df[df['Age'] == 0].index, inplace = True)
#check if dropped
df['Age'].value_counts(dropna='False')

#remove unused data 
df.drop(['AppointmentID','Scholarship','AppointmentID'], inplace=True, axis=1)
#check data 
df.head(1)

#Rename the columns which have incorrect spelling mistakes - this will helps us create columns in easy to understand way
df.rename(columns = {'Hipertension' : 'Hypertension', 'Handcap':'Handicap', 'No-show' : 'NoShow'}, inplace = True)
df.head(3)

#Changing the data type of scheduled_day to datetime
df['ScheduledDay']= pd.to_datetime(df['ScheduledDay'],format='%Y-%m-%d')
df.dtypes

df.head(3)

# Change Type string
df.Hypertension = df.Hypertension.astype('str')
df.Diabetes = df.Diabetes.astype('str')
df.Alcoholism = df.Alcoholism.astype('str')
df.Handicap = df.Handicap.astype('str')

# Replace every '1' with the disease name
df.Hypertension.replace('1','Hypertension' , inplace= True)
df.Diabetes.replace('1','Diabetes', inplace= True)
df.Alcoholism.replace('1','Alcoholism', inplace= True) 
df.Handicap.replace('1','Handicap', inplace= True)
# Replace every '0' with empty space
df.Hypertension.replace('0','' , inplace= True)
df.Diabetes.replace('0','', inplace= True)
df.Alcoholism.replace('0','', inplace= True) 
df.Handicap.replace('0','', inplace= True)

# combine (Hipertension , Diabetes , Alcoholism , Handcap) under diseases column
df['Diseases'] = df['Hypertension'].str.strip() + df['Diabetes'].str.strip() + df['Alcoholism'].str.strip() + df['Handicap'].str.strip()

# Replacing empty spaces in Diseases with 'No Diseases' 
df.Diseases.loc[df.Diseases == ''] = 'No Diseases'


df.head(3)

## Exploratory Data Analysis


## Histograming all numerical attributes (Hypertension, Diabetes ,Alcoholism ,Handcap )


plt.figure(1)
plt.figure(figsize = (15,10))
iter_cols = ['Diabetes','Handicap','Alcoholism','Hypertension']
#              , 'Alcoholism', 'Handicap']
colour = ['c', 'g', 'b', 'r']
i = 0
for col in iter_cols:    
    plt.subplot(int(str(22)+str((iter_cols.index(col)+1))))
    df[col].value_counts(normalize=True).plot.bar(figsize=(20,10), fontsize = 15, color = colour[i])
    plt.title(col, fontweight="bold", fontsize = 22)
    plt.ylabel('Count %', fontsize = 20)
    i = i +1   

It can be inferred from the above bar plots that:

* ~20% of patient instances have Hypertension.
* ~88% of patient instacnes do not have diabetes 



### Research Question 1 ( What is the percentage of male and female)

# Gender chart 
df['Gender'].value_counts().plot(kind = 'pie',autopct="%0.f%%");

### From data abouve 
* 66% are female 
* 34% are male



### Research Question 2  (The Number of appointments Show VS Not Show)

#bar chart for showed up vs not showed up
df['NoShow'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar',color=['black','blue'],title='Show - No show',alpha=.8);
plt.xlabel("Yes - No",fontsize=19);

plt.ylabel("How many ",fontsize=19);

### 88208 Show Vs 22319 No Show!



### Research Question 3 (The Number of People Received SMS vs Not)

# plot the gender column with respect to showed column
df['SMS_received'].hist()

#### We have 41904 Not received VS 20394 Received a SMS




## Research Question 4  (What days are the most likely that people didn't come in Age ?)

# Age Distribution
# Get the distribution for only NoShow = 1 / Yes
df = df[df['NoShow']  == "Yes"]
df.plot(kind = "hist",y = "Age",bins = 100, color = 'b') 
plt.title('Age of the patients - Did not Show up')
plt.xlabel('Age');

## Research Question 5 (People who have Diseases Came to appointment)

# Select people who came
df = df[df['NoShow']  == "Yes"]
# plot with respect to Diseases
df.groupby(['NoShow']).Diseases.value_counts().sort_values(ascending=False)[4::-1].plot(kind='barh');

plt.title("Most frequent diseases of people has appointment")
plt.xlabel("people")
plt.ylabel("Diseases");

### Most of the People has appointment have No Diseases
### hypertension is the first highest Disease common between who has an appointment



## Research Question 6 (People Age Vs Neighbourhood )

#Age vs Date of month
plt.scatter(x=df['Neighbourhood'],y=df['Age'])
plt.xlabel('Areas')
plt.ylabel('Date of Month')
plt.title('Scatter plot of Age vs Date of month')



## Research Question 7 ( Neighbourhood % )

# the neighbourhood %
df['Neighbourhood'].value_counts(normalize=True).sort_values(ascending = False)[:10].plot.bar(figsize=(24,6), fontsize = 15.0, color = 'b')
plt.title('Neighbourhood', fontweight="bold", fontsize = 22.0)
plt.ylabel('Count %', fontsize = 20.0)
plt.xlabel('Neighbourhood / Location', fontsize = 20.0)
plt.show()

###the top Neighbourhood has appointment was Jardim Camburi




<a id='conclusions'></a>
## Conclusions

* 1. Of those patients who have ppointment, 66% were Female and 34% Male

* 2. the Number of People have appointment were 88208 Show Vs 22319 No Show!

* 3. Hypertension and Diabetes patients are attending the doctor when compared to other medications. It can be inferred from the above bar plots that
 ~20% of patient instances have Hypertension.
~88% of patient instacnes do not have diabetes
* 4. We have 41904 Not received SMS VS 20394 Received a SMS
* 5. the top Neighbourhood has appointment was Jardim Camburi



## Limitation
> * 1- Some Date were not true as age they were ages between -1 and 0 and that doen't make any sense 
> * 2- Some Date Colums were Not corretly spilling makes some confused for Understanding as 'Hipertension'  'Handcap' 
> * 3- there are some missing values such as the price,the appoinments is affordable or not..
> * 4- the features such as different gender or alcoholic is not a factor to decide if the person would come to his appointment or not!
> * 5- Iâ€™m not completely sure that a good business-decision could rely only on these findings , It needs more research and more data to have a reliable answer the specified question
